### DASHBOARD 1: HOME
### KPI’S Requirement

1.	**Total Number of Calls:** We need to track and display the total number of calls received by our call centre over a specified period.
2.	**Total Call Duration in Hours:** It is crucial to understand the total amount of time our call centre staff spends on calls in hours, which can help us in resource allocation and capacity planning.
3.	**Total Call Duration in Minutes:** Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.
4.	**Average Call Duration in Minutes:** To assess the efficiency of our agents, we need to calculate and display the average call duration in minutes. This metric can help identify trends in call handling.
5.	**Response Time Percentage:** Response time is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. This KPI should display the percentage of calls answered within a predefined time frame, helping us gauge our ability to provide prompt service.

### Chart’s Requirement
1.	**Total Calls by Day (Column Chart):** Display a column chart that shows the total number of calls on each day over a specified time period.
2.	**Total Calls by State (Filled Map Chart):** Create a filled map chart that visualizes the total number of calls received from different states or regions.
3.	**Top Reason for Calls (Tree Map):** Implement a tree map chart to display the top reasons for calls. Each box in the tree map represents a call reason.
4.	T**otal Calls by Channel (Donut Chart):** Create a donut chart to showcase the distribution of calls by different communication channels.
5.	**Total Calls by Sentiment (Column Chart):** Utilize a column chart to illustrate the distribution of calls by sentiments (e, g., positive, negative, neutral)
